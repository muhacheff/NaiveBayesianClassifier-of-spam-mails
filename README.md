# NaiveBayesianClassifier of spam mails

## The code implements a simple letter classification system based on a Bayesian approach. 

## The main steps include:
### -Preprocessing of text (removing numbers, reducing to lowercase, lemmatization).
### -Training of the model by calculating the frequencies of words in two categories ("spam" and "non-spam").
### -Classification of new letters based on calculated probabilities.

## This code can serve as the basis for more complex text analysis systems.
